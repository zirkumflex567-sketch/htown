# 🚫 Fun-Kill Analysis  
## What We Must **NOT** Build (Under Any Circumstances)

This document exists to **protect the core fun** of the game.

Our game is:
- Chaotic by design
- Skill-driven, not grind-driven
- Streamer- and friend-group-focused
- Built around adaptation, not perfection

Anything that undermines those pillars is a **Fun-Kill**, no matter how clever it looks on paper.

## 1. Mandatory Optimization Instead of Optional Mastery

### ❌ Fun-Kill
Systems that **require perfect play** in order to survive or progress.

Examples:
- Combos that are required to deal meaningful damage
- Power or Systems mechanics where a mistake can instantly end a run
- Support mechanics without which enemies are effectively unbeatable

### Why This Kills the Game
- Chaos turns into stress
- Seat swapping becomes unfair
- Casual players feel useless
- Stream viewers don’t understand *why* the run failed

### ✅ Instead
- Everything is **optional optimization**
- Good play = bonuses, not survival
- Bad play = inefficiency, not punishment

> **Rule of Thumb:**  
> A bad player may slow the run down,  
> but must never be able to end it alone.

## 2. UI That Explains More Than It Lets You Play

### ❌ Fun-Kill
- Text-heavy tooltips
- Dense number walls
- Effects like “+3.5% if X > Y”
- UI that must be *read* during combat

### Why This Kills the Game
- Mobile players drop out
- Streams become boring to watch
- Seat swaps feel like switching to a spreadsheet

### ✅ Instead
- Icons, colors, motion, sound
- “Good / Bad / Better / Worse” instead of exact values
- Visual reactions, not calculations

> **Rule of Thumb:**  
> If an effect is not understandable within 0.5 seconds visually, it doesn’t belong in the game.

## 3. Systems That Punish Players for Not Knowing Them

### ❌ Fun-Kill
- Support actions that can actively harm the team by accident
- Power systems that can “break” the vehicle when used incorrectly
- Systems abilities that backfire without clear intent

### Why This Kills the Game
- Seat swaps create anxiety instead of humor
- New players feel guilty
- Teams play scared instead of chaotic

### ✅ Instead
- Inexperienced players can only play **suboptimally**, never destructively
- Risk exists only when consciously taken
- Mistakes reduce bonuses, not stability

> **Rule of Thumb:**  
> Seat swaps may cause panic — but never guilt.

---

## 4. Meta Dominance and “Correct Builds”

### ❌ Fun-Kill
- One or two upgrade paths are objectively superior
- Status effects scale exponentially without counters
- Discord / streamers define “the only viable build”

### Why This Kills the Game
- Endless runs feel the same
- Discovery dies
- Players copy instead of improvising

### ✅ Instead
- Many **side-grade** options instead of linear power
- Strong synergies that depend on situation and timing
- Counterplay over raw scaling

> **Rule of Thumb:**  
> The strongest build should depend on the situation, not a wiki.

---

## 5. Progression That Replaces Skill

### ❌ Fun-Kill
- Permanent upgrades that trivialize early runs
- Meta bonuses that punish new players
- Grinding to become competitive

### Why This Kills the Game
- Leaderboards lose meaning
- New players feel hopeless
- Skill stops mattering

### ✅ Instead
- Every run starts on equal footing
- Power comes from:
  - Decisions
  - Timing
  - Communication
- Cosmetics instead of power

> **Rule of Thumb:**  
> If a run ends because of meta progression instead of player mistakes, the design failed.

---

## 6. Chaos Without Readability

### ❌ Fun-Kill
- Too many effects at once
- Combos triggering without clear feedback
- Players don’t understand *why* something happened

### Why This Kills the Game
- Chaos turns into noise
- Players feel powerless
- Streams become incomprehensible

### ✅ Instead
- Chaos with **clear cause and effect**
- Every escalation has:
  - Sound
  - Color
  - Direction
- Combo feedback is brief and readable, then gone

> **Rule of Thumb:**  
> Chaos may surprise — it must never confuse.

---

## 7. Systems That Replace Teamplay Instead of Enabling It

### ❌ Fun-Kill
- Autoplay systems that “do the right thing”
- Bots outperforming humans
- Mechanics that remove the need to communicate

### Why This Kills the Game
- Cooperative identity disappears
- “We vs the world” becomes “the system handles it”
- Voice chat goes silent

### ✅ Instead
- Systems that **create reasons to shout**:
  - “BOOST NOW!”
  - “PING LEFT!”
- Bots are:
  - Reactive
  - Never creative
  - Always inferior to humans

> **Rule of Thumb:**  
> If nobody is yelling, the feature is wrong.

---

## 8. Feature Overload Without an Escalation Curve

### ❌ Fun-Kill
- Too many mechanics too early
- Adding systems instead of deepening existing ones
- Permanent cognitive overload

### Why This Kills the Game
- Learning curve becomes a wall
- Mobile players churn
- Chaos feels random, not earned

### ✅ Instead
- Few systems, many interactions
- Escalation over time
- Depth through combinations, not quantity

> **Rule of Thumb:**  
> A new system must create at least five new gameplay situations.

---

## 💣 The Most Important Fun-Kill Rule

> **If a system must be played perfectly,  
> it does not belong in a chaos game.  
> It belongs in a stress game.**

This game lives on:
- Improvisation
- Laughter
- “That was stupid, but it worked”

Anything that prevents that —  
**no matter how smart it looks** — gets cut.
