# Third-Party Assets

This project can optionally download placeholder art packs from OpenGameArt/Kenney during development.
If the downloads fail, the client renders procedural shapes instead.

## Sources
- Kenney UI Pack (via OpenGameArt mirror)
  - https://opengameart.org/content/kenney-ui-pack
- Kenney Topdown Shooter Pack (via OpenGameArt mirror)
  - https://opengameart.org/content/top-down-shooter-pack

## Notes
Run `npm run assets --workspace client` to attempt the download. The game will still run without these files.
